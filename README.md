# Tailwind CSS - Styles Not Applied Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied to components despite proper configuration.

## Problem

The Tailwind CSS configuration appears to be correctly set up, but the styles defined within the `tailwind.config.js` file are not applied to the components. The content array in `tailwind.config.js` might point to an incorrect directory, causing Tailwind to not pick up the components' styles.
